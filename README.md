**Question** 

Implement a Min-Heap

Write a program to implement a Min-Heap data structure. Your program should support the following operations:

**Requirements**

1) Insert an element into the heap.
2) Extract the minimum element from the heap.
3) Peek at the minimum element without removing it.
4) Print the heap as an array.

**Input/Output Examples**

**Example 1:** Insert and Print
Input: Insert elements 10, 5, 20, 2 into the heap.
Output: Print the heap as an array: [2, 5, 20, 10].


**Example 2:** Extract and Print
Input: Extract the minimum from the heap.
Output:
Minimum element: 2
Heap after extraction: [5, 10, 20].

**Example 3:** Peek at Minimum
Input: Peek at the minimum element.
Output: 5 (minimum element).

**Constraints**
Assume the heap stores integers.
Implement the heap as a dynamic array or similar structure.
Requirements
Use object-oriented principles to encapsulate the heap in a class.
Follow the Min-Heap property:
The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
